                a story with the reader.
                 A person who writes a poem is called a poet.
                 Many poems have words or phrases that sound good together when they are read aloud.
                 Most poems for children rhyme or they have rhythm (just like music) or repetition.
                But a poem doesn’t have to rhyme!
                 People have been writing poetry for over 4,000 years, but they were probably making
                up verses to recite in front of audiences long before that.
                 In Ancient Greece, some poems were sung or performed with music – just like a song.
                 William Shakespeare, William Wordsworth, Christina Rossetti, John Keats, Robert Louis
                Stevenson and Emily Dickinson are all famous poets from history. Have you heard of
                them? Look out for Christina Rossetti’s What is Pink? poem in Storytime Issue 12 and
                Robert Louis Stevenson’s Bed In Summer in Storytime Issue 3.
                 Modern children’s poets you might know include Michael Rosen (his poem Where
                Broccoli Comes From was in Storytime Issue 13), Brian Moses (The Budgie Likes to
                Boogie is in Storytime Issue 25), Benjamin Zephaniah, Jackie Kay, Roger McGough,
                Allan Ahlberg, Roald Dahl, John Agard, Jack Prelutsky and Shel Silverstein. Can you
                read a poem from each of the poets listed above or find their poetry being performed
                on YouTube? Which one is your favourite and why?

                There are many different types of poetry. Here are some you might know...
                Different Types
                of Poems
                Narrative Poems tell a story. You could say that Julia Donaldson’s books, such
                as The Gruffalo, are narrative poems. In Storytime Issue 1, we featured The Owl and the
                Pussy-cat by Edward Lear, which is a narrative poem.
                In Shape Poems (or Concrete Poems) the words are arranged to look like the
                thing you’re writing about. You could write a poem about a snake in a long wiggly line or
                a poem about rain inside a raindrop shape. For example:
                Nonsense Poems feature made-up words, characters or places, and are funny.
                In Storytime Issue 4, we featured the nonsense poem On the Ning Nang Nong by
                Spike Milligan. Other well-known nonsense poets are Lewis Carroll and Edward Lear.

                 It’s in the fast lane - whee!

                <p style="font-size:large; letter-spacing: 0.4px; background-color: blanchedalmond;">Below is a list of some of the most common types of poetry, their main characteristics, and famous examples of each.

                    You may prefer to read certain types of poems, while for other types you may enjoy writing your own! Familiarize yourself with these different styles and see if any spark your imagination.
                    
                    1. Sonnet
                    Sonnets are practically synonymous with Shakespeare, but there are actually two different kinds of this famous poetic form. Having originated in 13th century Italy, the sonnet usually deals with love and has two common forms: the Petrarchan (named for its famous practitioner, the poet Petrarch) and the Shakespearean (also known as the English sonnet). Each type contains 14 lines but comes with its own set of rules.

                    Turn (or “volta”) between 8th and 9th lines
                    Second stanza answers the question or issue posed in the first
                    Rhyme Scheme: ABBA, ABBA, CDECDE
                    Shakespearean Sonnet

                    <h2>Poetry has been around for almost four thousand years. Like other forms of literature, poetry is written to share ideas, express emotions, and create imagery. Poets choose words for their meaning and acoustics, arranging them to create a tempo known as the meter. Some poems incorporate rhyme schemes, with two or more lines that end in like-sounding words.

Today, poetry remains an important part of art and culture. Every year, the United States Library of Congress appoints a Poet Laureate to represent the art of poetry in America. From Shakespearean sonnets to Maya Angelou’s reflective compositions, poems are long-lived, read and recited for generations.</h2>
